     New Features of mHM v5.5
     (released at Jun 1st, 2016)
----------------------------------------

New Features:
- Routing works on domains with multiple outlets (e.g., continental level).
- New option for providing soil data. They can be provided as predefined layers (one map per layer).
- Speed up of mHM for big domains, due to reformulations in the model start up.
- Pre-processing: new tools for i)   cutting out a catchment from a existing dataset,
                                ii)  estimation of Hargreaves-Samani evapotranspiration, and
                                iii) enlarging the grids of the input files.

Bugs resolved:
- Assigning routing parameters is done properly now.

Known bugs:
None.

Restrictions:
1. For gfortran compilers mHM supports only v4.8 and higher.
2. If you wish to use a special process description of evapotranspiration (processCase(4)) please contact Matthias Zink (matthias.zink@ufz.de).
3. If you wish to use features connected to neutron counts (processCase(8)) please contact Martin Schrön (martin.schroen@ufz.de).
4. If you wish to use the multi-scale Routing Model as stand-alone version, please contact Stephan Thober (stephan.thober@ufz.de).

----------------------------------------
     New Features of mHM v5.4
     (released at Dec 1st, 2015)
----------------------------------------

New Features:
- The routing of mHM can be used as a stand alone version/independent software called multiscale Routing Model mRM, e.g. for coupling to other environmental models.
- A new output, i.e. fields of routed discharge, can be written now. They are stored in mRM_fluxes_and_states.nc and are controlled by a new namelist contained in the 'mrm_outputs.nml' file, which is an optional file.
- New calibration objectives have been incorporated. It is possible, additionally to the former objectives, to calibrate mHM with
* total water storage data (e.g. GRACE) data and discharge simultaneously (opti_function=15) and/or
* cosmic ray neutron counts (opti_function=17).
Therefore additional input is needed, respectively.
- New post-processing: a mHM python class for reading all inputs and outputs of a model run can be found in ./post-proc/.
- Reorganization of the NetCDF writing in mHM to simply future implementations of additional outputs.

Bugs resolved:
- Calibration with catchment average soil moisture (opti_function=10) works properly now.
- Discharge output for multi basin runs with different time periods for each basin works properly now.
- Hargreaves-Samani PET calculation (processCase(5)=1) is valid on southern hemisphere too now.

Known bugs:
None.

Restrictions:
1. For gfortran compilers mHM supports only v4.8 and higher.
2. If you wish to use a special process description of evapotranspiration (processCase(4)) please contact Matthias Zink (matthias.zink@ufz.de).
3. If you wish to use features connected to neutron counts (processCase(8)) please contact Martin Schrön (martin.schroen@ufz.de).
4. If you wish to use the multi-scale Routing Model as stand-alone version, please contact Stephan Thober (stephan.thober@ufz.de)

----------------------------------------
     New Features of mHM v5.3
     (released at Jun 1st, 2015)
----------------------------------------

New Features:
- simulation period and warming days can be now given per basin (see time_periods in mhm.nml)
- enabling use of MPI (set "mpi=true" in Makefile and use "#ifdef MPI" for MPI specific code)
- optional input data can be loaded for example to calibrate against soil moisture (see optional_data in mhm.nml)
- generation of ground albedo cosmic-ray neutrons (see processCase(10) in mhm.nml);
  please contact Martin Schrön (martin.schroen@ufz.de), if you like to use this new feature.
- several new objective functions, e.g. calibrating the Kling-Gupta efficiency of catchment's average
  soil moisture (opti_function=10) or calibrating multiple basins regarding Kling-Gupta efficiency of
  discharge (opti_function=14) among others
- L11 variables in restart files are now written as prpoper maps and not only dumped

Bugs resolved:
- calibration using potential evapotranspiration from input file (i.e. processCase(4)=0) was not working

Known bugs:
None.

Restrictions:
- If you wish to use a special process description of evapotranspiration (i.e. Hargreaves-samani, Priestley-Taylor,
  or Penman-Monteith) please contact Matthias Zink (matthias.zink@ufz.de).
  The special cases are set in mhm.nml (see processCase(4) ).
- If you wish to use the new feature of calculating neutron counts please contact Martin Schrön
  (martin.schroen@ufz.de).
  The feature can be enabled in mhm.nml (see processCase(8) ).
- The calibration against soil moisture is still purpose to research. The interested user may contact
  Matthias Zink (matthias.zink@ufz.de) for further details.

----------------------------------------
     New Features of mHM v5.2
     (released at Dec 1st, 2014)
----------------------------------------

New Features:
- chunk-wise reading of input data (see "timestep_model_inputs" in mhm.nml)
- complete revision of writing netCDF files
- possibility to discard multi-scale parameter regionalization (MPR) calculations (see "perform_mpr" in mhm.nml)
- several process descriptions of evapotranspiration implemented (see processCase(4) in mhm.nml): 
  (0) Read in potential evapotranspiration
  (1) Hargreaves-samani
  (2) Priestley-Taylor
  (3) Penman-Monteith
   --> please contact Matthias Zink (matthias.zink@ufz.de) if you use (1)-(3) since the code is not under GNU Public license up to now
- adding routines for signature calculations of time series (see src/mo_signatures.f90)
- new objective function for calibrating discharge with Kling-Gupta efficiency measure (see opti_function in mhm.nml)
- new output variables implemented (see mhm_outputs.nml)

Known bugs:

----------------------------------------
     New Features of mHM v5.1
     (released at Jun 1st, 2014)
----------------------------------------

New Features:
- OpenMP handling of routines such as the multi-scale parameter regionalization (MPR)
- Multi-scale implementation, i.e. running mHM simultaneously in several basins with different resolutions
- Automatic check case framework, i.e. testing new implementations on their validity and back-compatibility
- Implementation of inflow gauges, i.e. feeding discharge time series from upstream areas at catchment boundaries
- File gaugeinfo.txt specifying gauging stations is now part of namelist mhm.nml
- Code is now free of Numerical Recipes proprietary code
- Can now run on a single cell (no routing performed)
- Hydrological modelling resolution (L1) equal to morphological input data resolution (L0) possible
- Windows compatible (with Cygwin)
- Support of regular geographic coordinate systems (e.g lat-lon) in addition to equal-area coordinate systems (UTM)

Bugs resolved:
- Initialization of states was not correct when running mHM in calibration mode.
- Calculated parameter values (mhm_parameters.nml) not necessarily in bound (check added).
- Aggregation/Disaggregation of meteorological data corrected.
- Forecast with mHM did not work because modelling period was restricted to discharge data period.
- Wrong mapping of evaluation discharge gauges for runs involving multiple gauges.

Known bugs:
- Print out of River network in Config File is wrong for Multi-Basin setup, i.e., the River network is always correctly written for the first basin, but in correctly for following basins when these are either different ones or the same one with a different Hydrology or Routing resolution.
