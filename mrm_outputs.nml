!1)  First give the timestep for writing gridded model outputs
!    It should be integer and has to be perfectly divisible 
!    by the number of total modeling time steps
!2) Define main outputs of the model as namelist
!   the particular output flag is specified as .TRUE. / .FALSE
!   for writing /not writing the output to a file
! SYNTAX = ".TRUE." or ".FALSE."

! switch to control write out frequency of the gridded model outputs below
